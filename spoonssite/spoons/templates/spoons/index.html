      <h2>A spoons tracker for those with no spoons to waste.</h2>
      <p>What started as a simple story has evolved into a new way of expressing chronic illness in a way that even small children can understand.</p>
      <p>We aim to create a space that will allow people of all ages and illnesses to track their spoons, both in a positive (couting up) way and in a negative (counting down) way.</p>
      <p>Join today to discover a new way of tracking your daily energy expenditures and work toward a better, more stable future.</p>
